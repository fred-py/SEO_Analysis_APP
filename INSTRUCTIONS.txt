conda install
1. beautifulsoup
2. pandas
3. requests
4. conda install -n seo_analysis ipykernel --update-deps --force-reinstall
    NOTE: although conda installed ipykernel, the kernel was only recognised 
    after pip install and restarting vscode.
    Re-opening of vscode only solve the issue after running pip
